# SylviesFitnessCircuit

SylviesFitnessCicuit (SFCircuit.py) provides a python-based circuit training exercise program to perform at home alone or together with your friends.

The core of the program is based on the pysimplegui cookbook https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/ and the demo program WidgetTimer: 
https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Desktop_Widget_Timer.py

For now, lists of different workouts are accessible within the script. A Pre-Set Workout List can be modified within the script or chosen within the GUI (randomly “Surprise” or by “Your Choice”).  

WORKOUT and WARMUP LIST can be modified within the script.
Duration and frequency of workouts can be changed within the GUI.
